
# 🌐 Java Web Crawler – Search Bot 🔍  

### 🚀 Overview  
This repository hosts a **simple console-based web crawler**, or **Search Bot**, designed in Java. It efficiently scans and extracts URLs from web pages using **pattern matching** and **networking APIs**, making it a foundational tool for automated web data extraction.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
✅ **Java Console Application:** Develop a functional CLI-based crawler  
✅ **Pattern Matching:** Use **regular expressions** to extract URLs  
✅ **Java Collections:** Store and manage discovered links efficiently  
✅ **Java Networking API:** Access and retrieve web pages dynamically  
✅ **Java IO API:** Read and process webpage contents

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Java ☕  
- **Core Libraries & APIs:**  
  - 🔍 Java Regular Expressions (Pattern Matching)  
  - 🌐 Java Networking API (URLConnection, HTTP Requests)  
  - 🗂 Java Collections Framework (HashSet, ArrayList)  
  - 📄 Java IO API (BufferedReader for webpage parsing)

## 🛠 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Initialize:** Start the crawler from a given seed URL  
2️⃣ **Fetch Data:** Use Java Networking API to retrieve webpage content  
3️⃣ **Extract Links:** Utilize regex to find and store valid URLs  
4️⃣ **Expand Search:** Recursively crawl newly found links  
5️⃣ **Output Results:** Display extracted URLs and metadata

## 🚀 Getting Started  
### 🔧 Prerequisites  
Ensure you have:  
- Java **JDK 11+** installed  
- A working internet connection  

### 🏗 Setup & Execution  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RitankarDuttaBanik/WEB-CRAWLER/
cd java-web-crawler
javac WebCrawler.java
java WebCrawler "https://example.com"
```
Replace `"https://example.com"` with your desired **seed URL** to begin crawling!
